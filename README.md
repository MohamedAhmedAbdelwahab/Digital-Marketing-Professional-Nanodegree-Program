# Digital-Marketing-Professional-Nanodegree-Program
## Market your Content
In this project we want you to practice producing and marketing content about a subject you know very well – yourself!
In this project, all the focus is on you.
Content marketing is not only a powerful tool to increase awareness for a brand or product, 
but also an effective way for you to build your own ‘personal brand’ as a Digital Marketer.
## Crafting an Email Campaign
Throughout your projects, we have focused on the early parts of the customer 
acquisition funnel such as building awareness and gathering potential leads.

These top of the marketing funnel activities encompass everything from creating great content
and distributing that content across social channels, increasing awareness of your website 
through search engine optimization, or paying to advertise on the search engines. Now
we will turn our focus to email marketing, one of the higher converting marketing channels.

In particular, Email marketing serves as one of the best tools used to focus on engagement, conversion,
and retention within the customer buying journey.

In this project, we will create an email marketing campaign for either DMND, Corporate Training, or your company
and complete the various components needed to implement a successful email marketing campaign.
